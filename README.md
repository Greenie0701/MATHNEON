# MATHNEON - ARM for future series
* A C library that performs matrix/vector algebraic operations with NEON ARM intrinsic
* The Project is very similar to Ne10 project by ARM and contributors(All credits to Ne10 developers for giving such basic and well developed source for ARM intrinsic).
* But Ne10 is not supported for Windows on ARM, Since the project is originally written for Unix based ARM devices. 
* MATHNEON mainly focuses on supporting optimized math routines on Windows on ARM devices and help users/developers providing enough knowledge towards NEON intrinsic in a very basic way.
* Currently, MATHNEON supports Int32 and Float32 math rountines and the development is still in progress.
* Contributions and ideas are always welcome, please feel free to open an issue to start discussion.
